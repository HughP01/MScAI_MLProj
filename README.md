# Traffic Sign Recognition Project
This project consists of several machine learning (and deep learning) approaches to the task of Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). This project contains the full data pipeline from data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, augmentation, training, testing and inference.

This project examines neural networks featuring a Simple CNN and a Multi Column Deep Neural Network (MCDNN) both of which are trained on both grayscale and full colour images, for investigative and comparitive analysis. More basic machine learning methods such as random forest and support vector machine are also examined in this manner.

# Green AI
Furthermore all code was examined for its carbon emmissions and energy consumption using CodeCarbon a python library specialised for the task of effective, efficient and greener artifial intelligence.
